# ParkourNShoot (WIP)

This is an Unreal Engine 4 powered game

==============================================================================================
This game is a FPS with elements of parkour with a neon - minimalistic art style.
The main premise of the game is that the player gets a randomzied weapon that are avaiable to the player at the start of a level, and each weapon has a finite amount of ammo/uses/durability and when it reaches 0 the game will randomize another weapon for the player. The player is able to re-roll their weapon but afterwards they will have a cooldown until they are able to do so. 

The player is able to double jump, dash, wall run, grapple and grapple down to a surface.
